The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## About the App

I built this app as a take home assignment for a job application. It was incredibly fun getting to learn more about MaterialUI and continue to hone my skills in React, hooks, CSS, and HTTP requests. I learned a lot in this project, and I can't wait to take those skills to a new position.
